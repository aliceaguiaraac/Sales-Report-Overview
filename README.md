# Sales-Report-Overview


I used a dataset of sales data from a luxury car reseller based in São Paulo, Brazil.The company began its operation in Brazil in 2016. The CEO of the company needs a Dashboard that represents sales data in the period 2016 to 2019.

The goal is evaluating whether or not to continue selling Jaguar-branded cars and he would like to know how this manufacturer's car sales have evolved by year and by state.

The dashboard contain:

1-Total Sales 
2-Labor Cost By State
3-Delivery Cost by Manufacturer
4-Total sales by state
5-Total sales by manufacturer
6-Total sales per year
6-Sales average 
7- Sales Matrix
8-Total sales by manufacturer and state
9-Total sales by manufacturer and year

You’ll observe that the sales of the jaguar manufacturer is increasing every year, and that it is among the three manufacturers that sell the most, behind only the manufacturers Aston Martin and Rolls Royce.
